Hello everyone! This is the simple neural network powered by OpenCV. 

This program used the following concepts:

1. Open photos.
2. Find faces in the photos and try to recognize the emotions on these photos using the XML-map.
3. Smile! Seriously, smile! :)
4. Say cheese.
5. The program will take a picture of your face and write what emotion is on your face.

The script comments will help you to understand what script used to do in this program.
